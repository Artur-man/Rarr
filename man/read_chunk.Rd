\item{chunk_id}{A numeric vector or single data.frame row with length equal
to the number of dimensions of a chunk.}

\item{metadata}{List produced by \code{read_array_metadata()} holding the contents
of the \code{.zarray} file. If missing this function will be called

than read it repeatedly for every chunk.}

\item{s3_provider}{Character indicating whether the Zarr is store on S3 and
if so which platform.  Valid entries are "aws" or "other".  Leave as \code{NULL}
for a file on local storage.}
