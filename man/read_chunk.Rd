\title{Read a single Zarr chunk}
\usage{
read_chunk(zarr_array_path, chunk_id, metadata, s3_provider = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{zarr_array_path}{A character vector of length 1, giving the path to the
Zarr array}

\item{chunk_id}{A numeric vector or single data.frame row with length equal
to the number of dimensions of a chunk.}

\item{metadata}{List produced by \code{read_array_metadata()} holding the contents of the
\code{.zarray} file. If missing this function will be called automatically, but
it is probably preferable to pass the meta data rather than read it
repeatedly for every chunk.}

\item{s3_provider}{Character indicating whether the Zarr is store on S3 and
if so which platform.  Valid entries are "aws" or "other".  Leave as \code{NULL}
for a file on local storage.}
