\title{Print a summary of a Zarr array}
\usage{
zarr_overview(zarr_array_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{zarr_array_path}{A character vector of length 1.  This provides the
path to a Zarr array or group of arrays. This can either be on a local file system or
on S3 storage.}
}
\value{
The function invisible returns \code{TRUE} if successful.  However it is
primarily called for the side effect of printing details of the Zarr array(s)
to the screen.
}
\description{
When reading a Zarr array using \code{\link[=read_zarr_array]{read_zarr_array()}} it is necessary to know
it's shape and size. \code{zarr_overview()} can be used to get a quick
overview of the array shape and contents, based on the .zarray metadata file
each array contains.
}
\details{
The function currently prints the following information to the R console:
\itemize{
\item array path
\item array shape and size
\item chunk and size
\item the number of chunks
\item the datatype of the array
\item codec used for data compression (if any)
}

If given the path to a group of arrays the function will attempt to print
the details of all sub-arrays in the group.

\examples{

## Using a local file provided with the package
z1 <- system.file("extdata", "zarr_examples", "row-first",
                  "int32.zarr", package = "Rarr")

## read the entire array
zarr_overview(zarr_array_path = z1)  

## using a file on S3 storage
z2 <- "https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.4/idr0101A/13457539.zarr/1"
zarr_overview(z2)

}
