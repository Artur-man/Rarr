## Using the **DelayedArray** framework

```{r, loading-library, echo=FALSE}
library(Rarr)
```

**Rarr** can make use of the DelayedArray package to provide a more 'array-like' 
interface to Zarr array, and use delayed operations and block processing to 
efficiently work with large on-disk data.

To demonstrate using the DelayedArray framework, we'll pick the example file containing
32-bit integers arranged in the "column first" ordering.

```{r, use-example-2}
zarr_example <- system.file(
  "extdata", "zarr_examples", "column-first", "int32.zarr",
  package = "Rarr"
)
```

We use the function `ZarrArray()` to create a **ZarrArray** object backed by the Zarr file.

```{r, create-ZarrArray}
zarr_array <- ZarrArray( zarr_example )
```

We can print this to screen and see a nice visual representation of this 3 dimensional array, 
and confirm that the array is both a **ZarrArray** and **DelayedArray**

```{r, show-ZarrArray}
zarr_array
is(zarr_array)
```
